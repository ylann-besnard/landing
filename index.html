		    <p>Our idea is to have a team specializing in the creation of advertising intended for television only. A team that knows the smallest details and the stakes of an advertisement on television.

		    <h2>How to choose?</h2>
		    <p>Choosing us because it's obvious that there is a disconnect between the commercials that are continually being created on TV and the new generation watching. There is a gap between what the consumer wants to see and what the company shows us
